# LoI.SmartContracts
This repo contains examples of  Ethereum smart contracts to be used in combination with the [League of Identity](https://github.com/aragonzkresearch/leagueofidentity) (LoI) system.

## LoI for Google Business domains
A an example we provide a template of a DAO whose members can be the users who have valid emails of the form `user@domain.com` where `domain.com` is a parameter of the DAO.
Only users with such emails can vote proposals. Moreover the content of the proposal is encrypted and only owners of emails `@domain.com` can read the proposals.
